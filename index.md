Hi, everyone! I'm Ulyana Dupletsa, a PhD student in Astroparticle Physics at the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L'Aquila. I am studying gravitational waves from compact binary systems to probe the universe's expansion history, both with future, such as the Einstein Telescope, and current, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration gravitational-wave detectors. Research interests include gravitational-wave astronomy, data analysis, and Bayesian statistics.


## Gravitational Wave Cosmology with Compact Binaries
Probing the expansion history of the Universe is crucial to solving open issues in the standard cosmological model, such as the nature of dark energy and the tension in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from observations at early and late cosmological epochs.  Gravitational waves (GWs) constitute an independent approach to solving the Hubble tension problem.  They are natural cosmic rulers,  directly measuring the luminosity distance to the source, thus dubbed as standard sirens.
