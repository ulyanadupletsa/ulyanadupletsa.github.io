## Gravitational Wave Cosmology with Compact Binaries
Probing the expansion history of the Universe is crucial to solving open issues in the standard cosmological model, such as the nature of dark energy and the tension in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from observations at early and late cosmological epochs.  Gravitational waves (GWs) constitute an independent approach to solving the Hubble tension problem.  They are natural cosmic rulers,  directly measuring the luminosity distance to the source, thus dubbed as standard sirens.
