Hi, everyone! I'm Ulyana Dupletsa, a PhD student in Astroparticle Physics at the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L'Aquila. I am studying gravitational waves from compact binary systems to probe the universe's expansion history, both with future, such as the Einstein Telescope, and current, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration gravitational-wave detectors. Research interests include gravitational-wave astronomy, data analysis, and Bayesian statistics.
